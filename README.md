# Lancaster Baptist Tabernacle Website

> "Preaching the Truth in Love"

Welcome to the official repository for the Lancaster Baptist Tabernacle website. This project represents a "Divine Modern" design overhaul, merging sacred tradition with cutting-edge web aesthetics.

## 🌟 Design Philosophy: "Divine Modern"

This website was designed by a simulated council of 20 expert personas to create a digital sanctuary. The design language, **"Warm Glass"**, focuses on clarity, depth, and peace.

### Key Features
*   **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Floating "Glass Pill" navigation and frosted glass service cards that blur the background, creating a sense of depth and hierarchy.
*   **Divine Breath Animations**: Elements do not just appear; they float up and fade in (`.animate-up`), mimicking the natural rhythm of breath.
*   **Living Hero Section**: The homepage features a slow "Ken Burns" zoom effect on the sanctuary image, making the site feel alive.
*   **Sacred Typography**: A pairing of **Cinzel** (Headers) for majesty and **Inter** (Body) for modern readability.
*   **Premium Palette**:
    *   🌑 **Midnight Navy** (`#0a192f`): The foundation.
    *   ✨ **Starlight Gold** (`#d4af37`): For divine accents.
    *   ❄️ **Frosted White** (`#e6f1ff`): For text and glass elements.
